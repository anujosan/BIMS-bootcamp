# BIMS-bootcamp
Workshop materials for Practical computing and analysis for the biomedical researcher bootcamp 

Day4: Utilizing R to visualize and analyze data

This session will build on basic skills to explore best practices in exploratory data analysis using ggplot2, Râ€™s most prominent plotting package. In addition, we will investigate relationships between variables using classic statistical techniques. Participants will engage in active learning with instructor-led tutorials and problem sets that tackle real-world data analysis exercises.

All teaching materials were developed by [Data Services at the Health Sciences Library](https://data.hsl.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.
